        Azure VM disk's offer some disk caching options, namely:
        <ul>
            <li>Read/Write</li>
            <li>Read-only</li>
            <li>None</li>
        </ul>

        Detailed description can be found

        Some context:
        <br>
        I was using Azure's VM (Linux) with Read/write mode, big mistake. 
        I used it as a work machine and connected vis SSH over VSCode.
        I wrote some code, saved it, but I didn't push to GitHub, I know it was a mistake, usually I do not do this.
        From the desciption of Read/Write mode, it is the responsibility of the application to flush the cache. 
        So, VSCode did not call fsync correctly as a consequence I lost my data from the disk when I shut down the VM. 
        <br>
        This is a note to other people to make sure your application handles syncing of disk and memory if you decide to use Read/Write mode.
